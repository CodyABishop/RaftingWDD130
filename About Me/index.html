  <h2>Cody Bishop</h2>
  <h2>What's a nickname and where do I get one?</h2>
  <p>My name is Cody, though you already knew that from above. I was born in California, and moved to Utah when I was somewhere around the age of 12. I've been a member of the church for my entire life. My preferred hobbies are reading and playing video games.</p>
  <p>I'm not that interesting of a person, really. I stay indoors all day and if I'm not doing school work, I'm goofing off with my friends.</p>
